# HEY!

# You should __NEVER__ check credentials into version control. Thanks for reading :)
#
# This 'dummy' file is here because we need to point the dbt compiler
# (used by SQLFluff in CI/CD linting checks) to a valid profiles.yml file.
# Normally, this is found in ~/.dbt/profiles.yml on your local machine.
#     See docs: https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile#how-to-connect-to-your-warehouse-when-using-the-cli
#
# In the '.github/workflows/sqlfluff_lint_dbt_models.yml', we set the
# DBT_PROFILES_DIR environment variable to point the dbt compiler to look for
# the 'surfline' profile defined in this dummy profiles.yml file.
# You should __NEVER__ check credentials into version control. Thanks for reading :)

# NOTE:
# If the 'pass' key-value below has quotes around it in your local profiles.yml
# file, remove the qoutes when pasting into GitHub Secrets. Otherwise
# you'll get errors.
